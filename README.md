## Welcome to D&D//Bench, the D&D Character Management App

Here's a brief overview of what you can use the app for:

- creating multiple characters ✨
- managing your active character via the bench ✨
- displaying your active character's information ✨
- managing your characters' spells, feats, and inventory ✨

In the future, I'd like to implement a "battle mode" feature, which will allow for a dynamic overview of encounters, as well as implement an additional feature, that wil allow you to roll your character in the app.
I'm also aiming to further improve the way information is displayed and stored.

Thank you for your interest!
